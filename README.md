# Network-Threat-Intelligence-Analysis

📊 Automated defensive network analysis with OSINT enrichment and threat correlation

---

📡 Defensive network intelligence research and automation for security operations and analytic environments.

---

## 🗂 Overview

This repository demonstrates a Blue Team–focused approach to analyzing network activity,  
open-source threat intelligence, and vulnerability data in support of defensive cyber operations.  
The emphasis is on **analytical reasoning, correlation of intelligence, and repeatable workflows**,  
reflecting how network-centric threat intelligence informs operational decision-making.

---

## 🔍 Analytical Focus

Designed to support:

- Understanding network behavior and traffic patterns  
- Applying OSINT to contextualize observed activity  
- Correlating indicators of compromise with network-derived insights  
- Prioritizing risk to support informed defensive actions  

The goal is **clarity, attribution context, and defensibility**, not detection for its own sake.

---

## 📈 Operational Outcomes

Execution produces:

- Analyst-ready intelligence artifacts  
- Correlated threat indicators to guide mitigation  
- High-level visualizations summarizing network activity trends  
- Written summaries aligned with reporting and briefing standards  

Outputs are designed to provide **actionable insight for analysts and decision-makers**.

---

## ⚙️ Automation & Design

Analysis workflows are automated for consistency and repeatability while keeping final conclusions analyst-driven.  
Workflows mirror operational environments where **traceability, documentation, and discipline** are required.

---

## 🛡️ Intended Use

This repository is designed for:

- Defensive cybersecurity professionals  
- Threat intelligence analysts  
- Security operations teams in government, federal, or mission-driven organizations  

It demonstrates workflows, analysis methods, and outputs that **enable informed decision-making, operational awareness, and risk-based defense**.
