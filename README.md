# Network Threat Intelligence Analysis

⚠️ **Automated Network Threat Intelligence, OSINT Correlation, and Risk Prioritization** ⚠️

This repository implements an **automated defensive threat-intelligence pipeline** designed to simulate how a SOC ingests, enriches, correlates, and prioritizes security data from multiple sources.

It focuses on **actionable intelligence**, not raw data.

---

## 🎯 Project Purpose & Scope

The primary objective of this project is to:

- Correlate **network activity**, **OSINT threat indicators**, and **vulnerability data**
- Identify **high-risk assets and behaviors**
- Produce **repeatable, automated intelligence reports**
- Demonstrate real-world **SOC and Blue Team workflows**

This is **not** a scanner or IDS replacement.  
It is an **intelligence aggregation and prioritization layer**.

---

## 🔄 Automation & Update Frequency

⏱️ **Update Frequency:**  
- Runs automatically via **GitHub Actions**
- Executes **multiple times per day** (scheduled and trigger-based)

Each execution:
- Regenerates intelligence datasets
- Recalculates risk prioritization
- Updates charts and summaries
- Rewrites the README snapshot section automatically

All timestamps are recorded in **UTC**.

## 📡 Intelligence Sources & Analysis Layers

### 🛰️ Open-Source Threat Intelligence (OSINT)
- Simulated high-confidence Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)
- Includes IPs, domains, URLs, and file hashes
- Ranked by **confidence score**
- Models curated threat feeds (CERTs, ISACs, vendor intelligence)

### 🔥 Vulnerability Risk Analysis
- Simulated vulnerability scan results
- CVEs prioritized using a calculated **risk score**
- Reflects exploitability and operational impact
- Mirrors remediation-driven SOC workflows

### 🌐 Network Traffic Analysis
- PCAP-derived network activity analysis
- Identifies **top source IPs by connection volume**
- Highlights anomalous or suspicious traffic patterns
- Visualized for rapid analyst triage

---

## 📊 Network Activity Visualization

🚨 **Top Source IPs by Connection Volume**

![Network Threat Activity](build/charts/network_activity.png)

This chart highlights the most active source IPs observed in the analyzed traffic.  
Elevated activity may indicate:
- Reconnaissance or scanning behavior
- Misconfigured systems
- Potential malicious activity
